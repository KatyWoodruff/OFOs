## Summary
Currently, this search is only able to filter location, date, and shape information, and is unable to be more precise. To improve on it, I would suggest implimenting key words that can be searched from the comments data to be able to filter by certain experiences. This could aid in helping users who are looking for particular kinds of sightings.  I would also suggest adding a filter for duration, as this could again, help users to quickly identify the information they are searching for.
